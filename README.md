Play ads at regular intervals in your video

This is how it works:
1) PHP script picks first video from the "videos" folder and start playing it. Lets call it main video.
2) After set interval of time main video pauses and an ad starts playing. Ad videos are picked from "ads" folder. 
3) As soon as ad finishes, main video resumes. This is repeated till the main video is finised.
